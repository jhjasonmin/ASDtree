Decision tree for ASD

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder which causes a lack in social communication skills combined with repetitive and sensory behaviours (Lord et al 2020). The person also displays restricted interests. The paper also highlights that early detection of autism is advantageous as interventions to improve communication skills early in life has more effect and increase the potential of the patient. Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is an assessment to diagnose autistic symptoms through various questions. 

Data mining is an excellent tool in analysing the AQ assessment to decide on the presence of ASD. The dataset we will be working on contains some information regards to each subject and the results of each questions from a 10 questionnaire AQ assessment.

A Decision Tree was used for the questinonnaires to attempt to use as diagnosis.
